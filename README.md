# Mini-Project 2 - COMP 472

The purpose of this project is to generate a simple AI capable of adpative play for a n-size tic-tac-toe game. The AI uses either MINMAX or ALPHABETA to traverse board possibilities, with eitheir a heuristic that checks consecutivity or the nearest winning board.

## Requirements

The proper functioning of this project requires several installations.
- Python 3.8.3 or equivalent compatibility (using pip or conda)
- Pypy 3 or equivalent as an interpreter
- random (python library)
- numpy (python library)

## Usage

1. Download the code from [github](https://github.com/George540/comp472_mini_project_2)
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run the file **tictactoeMain**
4. You will encounter this menu screen
```Python
---------- Welcome to Team Oranges Mini-Assignment 2 for COMP 472 ----------

Would you like to use default values?
Defaults: AI vs Human, 3x3 grid, Traversal Depth = 3, Traversal Algorith = ALPHABETA, time threshold - 5s

Please select one of the following options: (y/n)
```
5. Input the correct settings as the command line prompts you. If you wish to run a quick test, you may simple select 'y'
6. Once the settings are chosen, the code will run. If a human player was select during the game options, you will need to input x,y coordinates every turn
